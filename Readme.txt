SinglyLinkedList Project
Overview
This project implements a Singly Linked List data structure in Java, designed to efficiently manage collections of data through a series of nodes that hold references to the next element in the list. The implementation includes all core operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal, demonstrating proficiency in foundational data structures.

Features
Insertion: Add elements at the beginning, end, or at a specified position in the list.
Deletion: Remove elements from any position, including the first, last, or a specified index.
Search: Linear search implementation to find elements within the list.
Traversal: Efficiently traverse the list to process or print each node's data.
Key Concepts
Pointer manipulation: Efficiently manage node references and pointers to ensure the integrity of the list.
Memory management: Understanding of manual node creation and garbage collection in Java.
Algorithmic complexity: Optimized operations with attention to performance and computational cost.
